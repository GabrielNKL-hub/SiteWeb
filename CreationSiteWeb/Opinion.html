<h1 class="titre-principal w3-container w3-center">The choice of this theme</h1>
<p>So I chose this theme because I love this eyes : the appearance, the flow cleared, the charisma brought is just incredible. In my site, you will discover the history of this mythical eye.
<br>This eye comes from of universe of <strong><mark>Naruto, a Japanese manga.</strong></mark> It is one of the largest manga read locally (in Japan) but also worldwide. For everyone, it is part of the big three Japanese mangas with : <strong>Dragon Ball Z, One Piece and Naruto.</strong>
<br>Moreover, as a major consumer of reading especially manga, I love this manga who is Naruto. The values transmitted in this manga is just masterful : It’s a real life lesson and we can recognize oneself through the characters.</p>
<p>Besides, I chose to talk to you about this theme because there is a character group that I love to the point that you will discover later. Honestly, even you will enjoy them despite the fact that they are a bit too stubborn and cruel (for some). But this their story is so well made that one can only be interested. In addition to their characteristic that makes them very famous : this eye.
